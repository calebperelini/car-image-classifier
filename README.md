# Car Vehicle Classification Model

This project aims to improve the accuracy of the [Plate Recognizer](https://platerecognizer.com/) ANPR by cross checking plate reads against an image classification model. 

The model itself was developed using Tensorflow with Keras, trained on the Vehicle Color Recognition Dataset, an annotated dataset of over 12,000 vehicles available [on kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/landrykezebou/vcor-vehicle-color-recognition-dataset)
